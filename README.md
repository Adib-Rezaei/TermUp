<h2>üí° About the app</h2>
<p>This is a tool for the students of University of Tehran helping them pick courses for their future semester. The app enables students to see their weekly schedule beforehand and find timing conflicts between the courses they're thinking about selecting rather than finding them through trial and error during the actual selection perioud. Users can search between the courses that are being taught in the next semester by entering the title of the course or the name of the professor who teaches the subject. Then they can add the course to their planning board and see how it looks among their other choices and know whether there are any timing conflicts between what they've already picked.</p>
<h2>üìö Using it!</h2>
    <p>You can find the latest release <a href='https://google.com' title='Google'> Here.</a> Keep in mind that TermOstad only consists of a client-side webapp, therefore all of your data including the courses you've picked and your preferences are stored locally on your device. To be more specific the app stores this data on the local storage your browser allocates to the website. You can always get rid of this data by clearing the local storage of your browser.</p>
